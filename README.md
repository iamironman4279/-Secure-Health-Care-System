# Secure Cloud-Based Healthcare System 🚀  
### Privacy-Preserving Data Sharing and Access Control 🔒  

---

## 🌟 Project Overview  
In today's digital healthcare ecosystem, balancing secure data sharing with patient privacy is paramount. The **Secure Cloud-Based Healthcare System** is an innovative solution designed to address this challenge. By integrating cutting-edge cryptographic techniques and access control mechanisms, this system ensures **confidentiality**, **integrity**, and **accessibility** of sensitive healthcare data in the cloud.  

Key features include:  
- 🔐 **Searchable Symmetric Encryption (SSE)** for secure, encrypted searches.  
- 🛡️ **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** for granular access management.  
- 💾 **AES-256 Encryption** for data protection and backups.  
- ✍️ **Digital Signatures** for authenticity and tamper-proofing.  
- ☁️ **Cloud Backup** to MongoDB Atlas with AES-256 encryption.  

This system is built to comply with healthcare security standards, offering a scalable and privacy-preserving platform for healthcare providers, patients, and administrators.

## 📋 Abstract  
The Secure Cloud-Based Healthcare System leverages advanced security technologies to protect patient data while enabling efficient collaboration. It employs **AES-256 encryption** to safeguard data at rest and in transit, ensuring confidentiality and integrity. **Searchable Symmetric Encryption (SSE)** allows authorized users to query encrypted data without compromising privacy.  

With **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**, access is strictly limited to authorized roles—such as doctors, patients, pharmacies, and cloud admins—ensuring only the right people can view or modify specific records. **Digital signatures** prevent unauthorized changes and verify data authenticity. For resilience, encrypted backups are stored in **MongoDB Atlas** using AES-256, protecting against data breaches.  

The system's performance is evaluated based on **security strength** and **search efficiency**, making it a robust and practical solution for modern healthcare needs.
