# Secure Cloud-Based Healthcare System 🚀  
### Privacy-Preserving Data Sharing and Access Control 🔒  

---

## 🌟 Project Overview  
Welcome to the **Secure Cloud-Based Healthcare System**, a cutting-edge solution crafted to revolutionize digital healthcare. In an era where data breaches threaten patient privacy, this system strikes the perfect balance between **secure data sharing** and **uncompromising confidentiality**. Built with a Python full-stack approach, it leverages advanced cryptographic techniques—**RSA** for key exchange and **AES-256** for data encryption—alongside robust access control to ensure healthcare data remains **secure**, **accessible**, and **scalable**.  

### Key Highlights  
- 🔐 **Searchable Symmetric Encryption (SSE)**: Perform encrypted searches without exposing sensitive data.  
- 🔑 **Dual Encryption**: RSA for secure key exchange, AES-256 for data protection.  
- 🛡️ **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Fine-tuned permissions for healthcare roles.  
- ✍️ **Digital Signatures**: Guarantee data authenticity and integrity.  
- ☁️ **MongoDB Atlas Backup**: AES-256-encrypted cloud backups for resilience.  
- 🐍 **Python Full-Stack**: Backend and frontend seamlessly integrated.  

Designed to meet stringent healthcare regulations (e.g., HIPAA, GDPR), this system empowers **doctors**, **patients**, **pharmacies**, and **admins** with a privacy-first platform that scales effortlessly.

## 📋 Abstract  
The Secure Cloud-Based Healthcare System is a fortress for patient data in the cloud. It employs **RSA encryption** for secure key distribution and **AES-256 encryption** to lock down data at rest and in transit, ensuring **confidentiality** and **integrity**. With **Searchable Symmetric Encryption (SSE)**, users can query encrypted records without decryption, preserving privacy.  

**Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** restricts access to authorized personnel—doctors view patient histories, patients manage their data, pharmacies process prescriptions, and admins oversee the system. **Digital signatures** prevent tampering, while **AES-256-encrypted backups** in **MongoDB Atlas** safeguard against data loss.  

Evaluated on **security strength**, **search efficiency**, and **system scalability**, this project delivers a robust, practical solution for modern healthcare collaboration.

## 🏗️ System Architecture  
### Core Components  
1. **Encryption Layer**:  
   - RSA: Asymmetric encryption for secure key exchange.  
   - AES-256: Symmetric encryption for data and backups.  
2. **Search Module**: SSE for privacy-preserving queries.  
3. **Access Control**: RBAC enforces role-specific permissions.  
4. **Authentication & Integrity**: Digital signatures (RSA-based) verify data authenticity.  
5. **Cloud Storage**: MongoDB Atlas with AES-256 encryption for backups.  
6. **Full-Stack Framework**:  
   - Backend: Python (Flask/Django) for API and logic.  
   - Frontend: Responsive UI with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  

### Data Flow  
- Patient data → RSA key exchange → AES-256 encryption → MongoDB Atlas storage.  
- Authorized users → RBAC check → SSE query → Decrypted results (if permitted).
